# Electric-Trike-Conversion
The aim of this project was to convert a conventional tricycle into an electrically powered vehicle for commuting and leisure use. The goal was to increase range, improve hill-climbing ability, and gain hands-on experience with DC motor control, battery systems, and power management.
